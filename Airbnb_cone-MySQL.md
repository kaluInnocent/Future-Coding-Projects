Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/FPJvEE-DRJDvmVTNWeFR8A "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
-   You must be able to explain what each component is doing
-   You must be able to explain system redundancy
-   Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

Requirements
------------

### General

[O-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
-   This project will be manually reviewed:
-   As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
-   Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use [imgur](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m_O2HLsKrO1zg31LMcLOGQ "imgur") but feel free to use anything you want).
-   For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
-   After pushing your answer file to GitHub, insert the GitHub file link into the URL box
-   You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
-   Focus on what you are being asked:
-   Cover what the requirements mention, we will explore details in a later project
-   Keep in mind that you will have 30 minutes to perform the exercise, you will get points for what is asked in requirements
-   Similarly in a job interview, you should answer what the interviewer asked for, be careful about being too verbose - always ask the interviewer if going into details is necessary - speaking too much can play against you
-   In this project, again, avoid going in details if not asked

Tasks
-----

### 0\. Fork me if you can!

mandatory

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

In the industry, you will work on an existing codebase 90% of the time. Your first thoughts upon looking at it might include:

-   "Who did this code?"
-   "How it works?"
-   "Where are unittests?"
-   "Where is this?"
-   "Why did they do that like this?"
-   "I don't understand anything."
-   "... I will refactor everything..."

But the worst thing you could possibly do is to **redo everything**. Please don't do that! **Note: the existing codebase might be perfect, or it might have errors. Don't always trust the existing codebase!**

For this project you will fork this [codebase](https://github.com/justinmajetich/AirBnB_clone.git "codebase"):

-   update the repository name to `AirBnB_clone_v2`
-   update the `README.md` with your information **but don't delete the initial authors**

If you are the owner of this repository, please create a new repository named `AirBnB_clone_v2` with the same content of `AirBnB_clone`

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `AirBnB_clone_v2`

### 1\. Bug free!

mandatory

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Do you remember the `unittest` module?

This codebase contains many test cases. Some are missing, but the ones included cover the basic functionality of the program.

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$

```

All your unittests **must** pass without any errors at anytime in this project, **with each storage engine!**. Same for PEP8!

```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$ HBNB_ENV=test HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m unittest discover tests 2>&1 /dev/null | tail -n 1
OK
guillaume@ubuntu:~/AirBnB_v2$

```

Some tests won't be relevant for some type of storage, please skip them by using the `skipIf` feature of [the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Gx_1dJOPPeAyeM6NaXDmjg "the Unittest module - 26.3.6. Skipping tests and expected failures"). Of course, the number of tests must be higher than the current number of tests, so if you decide to skip a test, you should write a new test!

### How to test with MySQL?

First, you create a specific database for it (next tasks). After, you have to remember what the purpose of an unittest?

**"Assert a current state (objects/data/database), do an action, and validate this action changed (or not) the state of your objects/data/database"**

For example, "you want to validate that the `create State name="California"` command in the console will add a new record in your table `states` in your database", here steps for your unittest:

-   get the number of current records in the table `states` (my using a `MySQLdb` for example - but not SQLAlchemy (remember, you want to test if it works, so it's better to isolate from the system))
-   execute the console command
-   get (again) the number of current records in the table `states` (same method, with `MySQLdb`)
-   if the difference is `+1` => test passed

### 2\. Console improvements

mandatory

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Update the `def do_create(self, arg):` function of your command interpreter (`console.py`) to allow for object creation with given parameters:

-   Command syntax: `create <Class name> <param 1> <param 2> <param 3>...`
-   Param syntax: `<key name>=<value>`
-   Value syntax:
    -   String: `"<value>"` => starts with a double quote
        -   any double quote inside the value must be escaped with a backslash `\`
        -   all underscores `_` must be replace by spaces . Example: You want to set the string `My little house` to the attribute `name`, your command line must be `name="My_little_house"`
    -   Float: `<unit>.<decimal>` => contains a dot `.`
    -   Integer: `<number>` => default case
-   If any parameter doesn't fit with these requirements or can't be recognized correctly by your program, it must be skipped

**Don't forget to add tests for this new feature!**

Also, this new feature will be tested here only with `FileStorage` engine.

### 5\. Delete object

mandatory

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Update `FileStorage`: (`models/engine/file_storage.py`)

-   Add a new public instance method: `def delete(self, obj=None):` to delete `obj` from `__objects` if it's inside - if `obj` is equal to `None`, the method should not do anything
-   Update the prototype of `def all(self)` to `def all(self, cls=None)` - that returns the list of objects of one type of class. Example below with `State` - it's an optional filtering

```

### 6\. DBStorage - States and Cities

mandatory

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

SQLAlchemy will be your best friend!

It's time to change your storage engine and use `SQLAlchemy`

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/alx-intranet.hbtn.io/uploads/medias/2020/9/daaef631636b40e0a279a8f240703e065f9d3481.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIARDDGGGOUSBVO6H7D%2F20220427%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220427T200927Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=cd76052efdb90c379c433e76fb9cf6911083098a0d445e2e4fe489c4be3a5ade)

In the following steps, you will make multiple changes:

-   the biggest one is the transition between `FileStorage` and `DBStorage`: In the industry, you will never find a system who can work with both in the same time - but you will find a lot of services who can manage multiple storage systems. (for example, logs service: in memory, in disk, in database, in ElasticSearch etc...) - The main concept behind is the **abstraction**: Make your code running without knowing how it's stored.
-   add attributes for SQLAlchemy: they will be class attributes, like previously, with a "weird" value. Don't worry, these values are for description and mapping to the database. If you change one of these values, or add/remove one attribute of the a model, you will have to delete the database and recreate it in SQL. (Yes it's not optimal, but for development purposes, it's ok. In production, we will add "migration mechanism" - for the moment, don't spend time on it.)

Please follow all these steps:

Update `BaseModel`: (`models/base_model.py`)

-   Create `Base = declarative_base()` before the class definition of `BaseModel`
-   **Note! BaseModel does /not/ inherit from Base. All other classes will inherit from BaseModel to get common values (id, `created_at`, `updated_at`), where inheriting from Base will actually cause SQLAlchemy to attempt to map it to a table.**
-   Add or replace in the class `BaseModel`:
    -   class attribute `id`
        -   represents a column containing a unique string (60 characters)
        -   can't be null
        -   primary key
    -   class attribute `created_at`
        -   represents a column containing a datetime
        -   can't be null
        -   default value is the current datetime (use `datetime.utcnow()`)
    -   class attribute `updated_at`
        -   represents a column containing a datetime
        -   can't be null
        -   default value is the current datetime (use `datetime.utcnow()`)
-   Move the `models.storage.new(self)` from `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):` to `def save(self):` and call it just before `models.storage.save()`
-   In `def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):`, manage `kwargs` to create instance attribute from this dictionary. Ex: `kwargs={ 'name': "California" }` => `self.name = "California"` if it's not already the case
-   Update the `to_dict()` method of the class `BaseModel`:
    -   remove the key `_sa_instance_state` from the dictionary returned by this method **only if this key exists**
-   Add a new public instance method: `def delete(self):` to delete the current instance from the storage (`models.storage`) by calling the method `delete`

Update `City`: (`models/city.py`)

-   `City` inherits from `BaseModel` and `Base` (respect the order)
-   Add or replace in the class `City`:
    -   class attribute `__tablename__` -
        -   represents the table name, `cities`
    -   class attribute `name`
        -   represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
        -   can't be null
    -   class attribute `state_id`
        -   represents a column containing a string (60 characters)
        -   can't be null
        -   is a foreign key to `states.id`

Update `State`: (`models/state.py`)

-   `State` inherits from `BaseModel` and `Base` (respect the order)
-   Add or replace in the class `State`:
    -   class attribute `__tablename__`
        -   represents the table name, `states`
    -   class attribute `name`
        -   represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
        -   can't be null
    -   for `DBStorage`: class attribute `cities` must represent a relationship with the class `City`. If the `State` object is deleted, all linked `City` objects must be automatically deleted. Also, the reference from a `City` object to his `State` should be named `state`
    -   for `FileStorage`: getter attribute `cities` that returns the list of `City` instances with `state_id` equals to the current `State.id` => It will be the `FileStorage` relationship between `State` and `City`

New engine `DBStorage`: (`models/engine/db_storage.py`)

-   Private class attributes:
    -   `__engine`: set to `None`
    -   `__session`: set to `None`
-   Public instance methods:
    -   `__init__(self):`
        -   create the engine (`self.__engine`)
        -   the engine must be linked to the MySQL database and user created before (`hbnb_dev` and `hbnb_dev_db`):
            -   dialect: `mysql`
            -   driver: `mysqldb`
        -   all of the following values must be retrieved via environment variables:
            -   MySQL user: `HBNB_MYSQL_USER`
            -   MySQL password: `HBNB_MYSQL_PWD`
            -   MySQL host: `HBNB_MYSQL_HOST` (here = `localhost`)
            -   MySQL database: `HBNB_MYSQL_DB`
        -   don't forget the option `pool_pre_ping=True` when you call `create_engine`
        -   drop all tables if the environment variable `HBNB_ENV` is equal to `test`
    -   `all(self, cls=None)`:
        -   query on the current database session (`self.__session`) all objects depending of the class name (argument `cls`)
        -   if `cls=None`, query all types of objects (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Amenity`, `Place` and `Review`)
        -   this method must return a dictionary: (like `FileStorage`)
            -   key = `<class-name>.<object-id>`
            -   value = object
    -   `new(self, obj)`: add the object to the current database session (`self.__session`)
    -   `save(self)`: commit all changes of the current database session (`self.__session`)
    -   `delete(self, obj=None)`: delete from the current database session `obj` if not `None`
    -   `reload(self)`:
        -   create all tables in the database (feature of SQLAlchemy) (WARNING: all classes who inherit from `Base` must be imported before calling `Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`)
        -   create the current database session (`self.__session`) from the engine (`self.__engine`) by using a [sessionmaker](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/FhKkGICnmM0DN4TrlfJw3g "sessionmaker") - the option `expire_on_commit` must be set to `False` ; and [scoped_session](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/kSil6Cs0L7bWTXNJTrk9yw "scoped_session") - to make sure your Session is thread-safe

Update `__init__.py`: (`models/__init__.py`)

-   Add a conditional depending of the value of the environment variable `HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE`:
    -   If equal to `db`:
        -   Import `DBStorage` class in this file
        -   Create an instance of `DBStorage` and store it in the variable `storage` (the line `storage.reload()` should be executed after this instantiation)
    -   Else:
        -   Import `FileStorage` class in this file
        -   Create an instance of `FileStorage` and store it in the variable `storage` (the line `storage.reload()` should be executed after this instantiation)
-   This "switch" will allow you to change storage type directly by using an environment variable (example below)

### 10\. DBStorage - Amenity... and BOOM!

mandatory

Score: 0.00% (Checks completed: 0.00%)

Update `Amenity`: (`models/amenity.py`)

-   `Amenity` inherits from `BaseModel` and `Base` (respect the order)
-   Add or replace in the class `Amenity`:
    -   class attribute `__tablename__`
        -   represents the table name, `amenities`
    -   class attribute `name`
        -   represents a column containing a string (128 characters)
        -   can't be null
    -   class attribute `place_amenities` must represent a relationship [Many-To-Many](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/LiU5umFamh-YbwWkgd8kNw "Many-To-Many") between the class `Place` and `Amenity`. Please see below more detail: `place_amenity` in the `Place` update

Update `Place`: (`models/place.py`)

-   Add an instance of [SQLAlchemy Table](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Pngd-iHVu-kUMyq5VaC9PQ "SQLAlchemy Table") called `place_amenity` for creating the relationship [Many-To-Many](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/LiU5umFamh-YbwWkgd8kNw "Many-To-Many") between `Place` and `Amenity`:
    -   table name `place_amenity`
    -   `metadata = Base.metadata`
    -   2 columns:
        -   `place_id`, a string of 60 characters foreign key of `places.id`, primary key in the table and never null
        -   `amenity_id`, a string of 60 characters foreign key of `amenities.id`, primary key in the table and never null
-   Update `Place` class:
    -   for `DBStorage`: class attribute `amenities` must represent a relationship with the class `Amenity` but also as `secondary` to `place_amenity` with option `viewonly=False` (`place_amenity` has been define previously)
    -   for `FileStorage`:
        -   Getter attribute `amenities` that returns the list of `Amenity` instances based on the attribute `amenity_ids` that contains all `Amenity.id` linked to the `Place`
        -   Setter attribute `amenities` that handles `append` method for adding an `Amenity.id` to the attribute `amenity_ids`. This method should accept only `Amenity` object, otherwise, do nothing.

### What's a `Many-to-Many` relationship?

In our system, we don't want to duplicate amenities (for example, having 10000 time the amenity `Wifi`), so they will be unique. But, at least 2 places can have the same amenity (like `Wifi` for example). We are in the case of:

-   an amenity can be linked to multiple places
-   a place can have multiple amenities

= `Many-To-Many`

To make this link working, we will create a third table called `place_amenity` that will create these links.

And you are good, you have a new engine!
